## [Roadmap](#roadmap)
Full steam ahead to 1.0.0 which will be the first official release that should be suitable for a production enviroment. In this version, you will be building directly over the template, making all of your changes withing the core files... yuck. Version 2.0.0 will introduce child themes where the U3 framework will act as a parent and your overrides are done within a child theme, allowing us to update the U3 framework at any time to add new features and enhancements, similar to most other template engines out there. Eventually, we hope to expand the codebase to include Joomla and Drupal as well, but those are questionable and way down the line.
